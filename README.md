# ReactNative-ToDoApp
Welcome To My React Native ToDoApp Project!__
You need to have a Simulator for testing the app.__
- For Android : Android Studio__
- For IOS : XCode__
After installing the repo, run 'npm run start' and then press A for android.__
(The configurations that you need for simulator is your own responsibility.)__
Enjoy!
