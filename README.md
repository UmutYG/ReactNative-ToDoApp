# ReactNative-ToDoApp
Welcome To My React Native ToDoApp Project!
You need to have a Simulator for testing the app.
- For Android : Android Studio
- For IOS : XCode
After installing the repo, run 'npm run start' and then press A for android.
(The configurations that you need for simulator is your own responsibility.)
Enjoy!
