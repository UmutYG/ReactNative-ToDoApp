# ReactNative-ToDoApp
Welcome To My React Native ToDoApp Project <br />
You need to have a Simulator for testing the app. <br />
- For Android : Android Studio <br />
- For IOS : XCode <br />
After installing the repo, run 'npm run start' and then press A for android. <br />
(The configurations that you need for simulator is your own responsibility.) <br />
Enjoy!
